[PHP 官方](http://www.php.net)宣佈停止對 PHP4 的支援了，原文如下：
<blockquote>

### PHP 4 end of life announcement
<span class="newsdate">[13-Jul-2007]</span>

Today it is exactly three years ago since PHP 5 has been released. In those three years it has seen many improvements over PHP 4. PHP 5 is fast, stable &amp; production-ready and as PHP 6 is on the way, PHP 4 will be discontinued.

The PHP development team hereby announces that support for PHP 4 will continue until the end of this year only. After 2007-12-31 there will be no more releases of PHP 4.4. We will continue to make critical security fixes available on a case-by-case basis until 2008-08-08. Please use the rest of this year to make your application suitable to run on PHP 5.

For documentation on migration for PHP 4 to PHP 5, we would like to point you to our [migration guide](/manual/en/migration5.php). There is additional information available in the [PHP 5.0 to PHP 5.1](/manual/en/migration51.php) and [PHP 5.1 to PHP 5.2](/manual/en/migration52.php) migration guides as well.

對某些人來說大概是壞消息，但對我而言卻是很棒的新聞。

PHP 終於醒了...
