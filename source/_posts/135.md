## 說明

這兩天是 Zend 的研討會，有很多大師級人物主講。其中 Best Practices of PHP Development 是 10/31 號的一個議題，提到了一些在 PHP 開發上比較好的規則，大家可以參考看看。

其他還有很多不錯的議題，有空再去收集相關的資訊。

## 重點節錄
<blockquote>

### Source Documentation

* PHPDoc is the defacto documentation standard, it can be parsed by PHPDocumentor and Doxygen 
* Use @category and  @package to manage your documentation
* Using PHPDoc allows all developers to immediately understand your code


### Unit Testing

* Focusing on PHPUnit
* Test religiously
* Without tests, code is fragile and will regress - there is nothing to tell you when you break your code.
* You are not wasting time by creating tests, you're wasting time by peppering your code with var_dump() and trying to debug code manually.
* Learning to write good object oriented code that is testable takes practice and discipline. Learn to design for usability. 
* Test-First methodology allows the tests to become the specification of code you are writing. 
* Using Classes is not Object Oriented Design


### Source Control

* Source control was on the benefits of using SVN to manage your code.
* Learn to use tagging and branching instead of committing everything to HEAD 
* Trac is cool (I caught up on emails during this section - great wifi) 


### Deployment

* Never edit code on the server
* Check out tagged branches from your svc software
* Deploy to a staging server on your production server, test first then modify the symlink.
* Write acceptance and integration tests: http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/book/17)
* Monitor Health of Servers: http://www.plope.com/software/supervisor/
* Store schema of your database by committing the schema into your svc server - suggestion: http://www.mysqldiff.org/ and pre-commit hooks
