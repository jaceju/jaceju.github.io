不用等 PHP6 了， [Frank Kleine](http://www.stubbles.org/archives/22-Namespaces-in-action.html) 說 PHP 5.3 就會把 Namespace 帶回來了。原文如下：
<blockquote>

Today I saw PHP namespaces in action. Timm Friebe, who [backported the namespace patch to PHP5](http://www.stubbles.org/exit.php?url_id=182&amp;entry_id=22), showed me a namespaced version of the XP-Framework. This was very impressive! We experimented a bit with __autoload() and it was very nice to see that the function is not called on the import but actually when the class is used within the code. Additionally we played around with full and non qualified classnames, with and without the import statement. What I saw looks really promising. Keep your fingers crossed that we will get a PHP5.3 with namespaces!
